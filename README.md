A proposed blind extracting algorithm of hidden data embedded by the multi-carrier spread-spectrum scheme. See Details in  "Lattice-Aided Extraction of Spread-Spectrum Hidden Data". Or contact the author Fan Yang: fanyang1124@163.com

Compare different extracting algorithms including:

1. MMSE(Minimum Mean Square Error)
2. JADE(Jean-Franccois Cardoso,et al."Blind beamforming for non Gaussian signals","High-order contrasts for independent component analysis")
3. M_IGLS(Iterative General Least Square)
5. M_ISIC(Iterative Successive Interference Cancelation)
5. sph_dec(Sphere Decoding)
